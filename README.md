# WDI Teach Yo Self: Gatsby Intro and Demo

## Motivation

I like the idea of using a static site generator for my personal site, because I like the idea of using a JAM stack (JavaScript, Angular, Markdown) to easily add content (ie **_blog posts_** and **_portfolio projects_**) with markdown.

There are many options, and the three that I am most interested in are [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). I chose to dive into Gatsby first because it implements React (which I think makes it more of an (unfortunatly named) JRM stack) and it appears I will be able to make templates for both Blog Posts and Portfolio Projects, whereas with something like Hugo I was a little less sure how much customization I have outside of a conventional blog-like site.

In researching Gatsby, I relied heavily on the [official documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/), as well as a tutorial from [LevelUpTuts](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/).

This repo is the result of my creating a Gatsby site from scratch.
